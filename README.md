# pocket-sai

This is a personal project to build an apparatus, which I'm calling PocketSai, that sits next to a go board and "enhances" the experience. More specifically, I want to be able to:

- record games that I play against people in person. After I finish playing a game, I would like PocketSai to email each player an SGF of the game so the player can keep a record of it and study it later in order to improve.
- play against people online using my go board as an interface, instead of sitting at a computer screen. PocketSai will connect to a go server of my choice, find an opponent, and then as I will play my moves on my physical go board, PocketSai will register the location of those moves and submit them through the online interface. When my online opponent makes a move, PocketSai will announce or somehow identify the location on the board. In long term, I would like to build a robotic arm that can place my opponents stones on my go board.

PocketSai will consist of a raspberry pi and camera module with a 3d printed apparatus to hold the pi and allow it to be placed next to a physical go board.
